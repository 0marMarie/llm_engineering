      "Image credits: Evan Shoemaker\n",
      "H\n",
      "ere’s the deal - you can have a kick-ass design system that’s got all the bells and whistles, like a bunch of well-structured components, solid documentation, killer guidelines, and a well-thought-out design language. But, if a user can’t actually do what they need to do with it, the whole thing is gonna be useless. So, let’s make sure that our design system is not just pretty to look at but it’s also functional and user-friendly.\n",
      "Wait! Before that, I said “federated” in the description of this article! Yes, I am going to talk about the process of opening up the design system for every designer in your organization!\n",
      "PS: To know more about Federated teams,\n",
      "read Nathan Curtis’s article on team modals\n",
      ".\n",
      "So, you might be wondering, how can we get everyone involved in the design system?\n",
      "Here’s the thing: the people who are actually using the system are creators too! If we introduce a model of governance and co-creation, we can make sure that everyone’s needs, concerns, and desires are taken into account from the get-go. That way, we can make a design system that works for everyone, and we can all be proud of what we create together!\n",
      "Embracing an open design system culture\n",
      "Some folks worry that a design system might limit their creative freedom, but it doesn’t have to be that way.\n",
      "We can have both consistency and flexibility if we open up the design system for feedback, input, and exploration.\n",
      "When everyone gets a say, it leads to better components and a real sense of ownership.\n",
      "The only thing is, making changes to the design system can cause issues like discrepancies between files, outdated documentation, and extra work for developers. Plus, we need to make sure that any changes we make are actually beneficial for the teams we’re serving.\n",
      "So, how do we avoid creating discrepancies while still giving designers and developers the power to make decisions on their own? It’s a tricky question, but one that we can figure out together!\n",
      "Everyone can be an initiator of change.\n",
      "Alright, let’s start by talking about the role of the design system team! One of our main jobs is to allow and orchestrate change, which is where governance comes in. We need to create a process that we can use over and over again, and we need the right tools to make decisions and move the design system forward.\n",
      "The key is to make sure that everyone is playing by the same rules.\n",
      "So, the first step is to agree on the defined components and patterns that are part of the design system and make sure that the Figma library matches the Git Repository to avoid any discrepancies. We used Figma as the Definition of Ready document for development to keep things on track.\n",
      "Now, if someone encounters an issue where the components aren’t solving a new use case, they can challenge the status quo.\n",
      "It doesn’t matter if they’re a designer, developer, or content designer — we encourage everyone to question whether something is working or not. Then, we work with the initiator to figure out if the new proposal applies to other use cases involving the same component. That way, we can make sure that everyone’s needs are met and we can keep moving forward!\n",
      "If you're looking for governance guidelines on Design Systems, then I have detailed them in a different article here.\n",
      "The consolidation process\n",
      "A weekly session for designers to collaborate better\n",
      "If you were a designer in my company working on focused product segments, then I would advise you to present in one of the ‘UX Friday’ sessions, or you could just use the following steps to collaborate with the design system team to co-create.\n",
      "3 Simple steps to make this happen:\n",
      "One of the main goals of the design system team is for every designer to feel empowered to take the initiative and suggest enhancements\n",
      "to existing components or propose new ones that will solve issues that the design system doesn’t currently address. Don’t be afraid to speak up!\n",
      "1. Prepare a component case:\n",
      "Prepare your case in the Figma playground file. It’s a template that contains all sorts of helpful tools to share your proposal with the team. The playground file will ideally include :\n",
      "A checklist to help you document your solution:\n",
      "This will help you explain how your proposed improvement solves the issue. If you’re improving an existing component, can you explain how it’s still usable for its initial use cases?\n",
      "A checklist to help you ensure you’re applying the design system’s foundation and guidelines correctly:\n",
      "You want to make sure that your proposed change won’t negatively affect anything else in the system.\n",
      "A space to provide the full context of the issue:\n",
      "This will help the team understand the problem better and see if other participants have experienced similar issues.\n",
      "A space to show research results:\n",
      "If you have user research or examples of other design systems that handle similar issues well, this is the place to share them.\n",
      "I\n",
      "have written a detailed article around “Vetting components for design system” which can provide more insights on this topic.\n",
      "2. Present on a\n",
      "consolidation call\n",
      ":\n",
      "Next, present your\n",
      "component case\n",
      "with the Figma playground file in an open forum setting that occurs weekly or biweekly.\n",
      "Anyone can join and participate, regardless of their discipline.\n",
      "During the consolidation call, we’ll critique the proposal from multiple angles to strengthen the applicability of the component.\n",
      "We’ll gather examples of how we currently use the component and play around with the new proposal within our use cases.\n",
      "The consolidation call includes multiple participants, including at least one developer, and we may even invite participants from other disciplines, like a copywriter.\n",
      "By identifying every application of the component in these use cases, we can redefine the components’ usage in the Figma playground file.\n",
      "Once the consolidation has proven successful, you can implement the change by renewing the components page in Figma.\n",
      "3. The Final Step:\n",
      "The final step is to get assistance from a designer on the design system team or hand the component entirely over to the DS team to add a few more details to the Figma playground file, including the naming of the component, a user story, types, states, and options defined, tokens or variables defined, breakpoint behavior, and more.\n",
      "In short, the consolidation process is all about empowering everyone to suggest changes, gather feedback, and arrive at a solution that works for everyone.\n",
      "Don’t forget to push your PMs\n",
      "When a changed component is encountered, the PM in charge of that area and will include it in your sprint planning. Usually, the feature team of the person who initiated the change will be the one to work on it. Finally, we make sure to communicate these changes to the business and update any relevant documents.\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "By establishing a clear and easy-to-follow process for proposing and implementing changes to the design system, everyone has an opportunity to share their ideas and contribute to its evolution. The “Figma playground file” is a valuable tool that enables team members to articulate their proposals in a clear and structured way, making it easier for the design system team to assess the impact of proposed changes and ensure they align with the design system’s core values and principles.\n",
      "One of the most enjoyable aspects of this process is the collaboration between designers from different disciplines during the consolidation process. This creates a greater understanding and appreciation of each other’s roles and expertise, which helps to build trust and foster a culture of collaboration.\n",
      "Ultimately, this process aligns with the core values of the design system, which are collaboration, clarity, and trust. By embracing these values and working together, we can create a design system that is both functional and sustainable and that meets the needs of all stakeholders.\n",

But, if a user can’t actually do what they need to do with it, the whole thing is gonna be useless. So, let’s make sure that our design system is not just pretty to look at but it’s also functional and user-friendly.\\nWait! Before that, I said “federated” in the description of this article! Yes, I am going to talk about the process of opening up the design system for every designer in your organization!\\nPS: To know more about Federated teams,\\nread Nathan Curtis’s article on team modals\\n.\\nSo, you might be wondering, how can we get everyone involved in the design system?\\nHere’s the thing: the people who are actually using the system are creators too! If we introduce a model of governance and co-creation, we can make sure that everyone’s needs, concerns, and desires are taken into account from the get-go. That way, we can make a design system that works for everyone, and we can all be proud of what we create together!\\nEmbracing an open design system culture\\nSome folks worry that a design system might limit their creative freedom, but it doesn’t have to be that way.\\nWe can have both consistency and flexibility if we open up the design system for feedback, input, and exploration.\\nWhen everyone gets a say, it leads to better components and a real sense of ownership.\\nThe only thing is, making changes to the design system can cause issues like discrepancies between files, outdated documentation, and extra work for developers. Plus, we need to make sure that any changes we make are actually beneficial for the teams we’re serving.\\nSo, how do we avoid creating discrepancies while still giving designers and developers the power to make decisions on their own? It’s a tricky question, but one that we can figure out together!\\nEveryone can be an initiator of change.\\nAlright, let’s start by talking about the role of the design system team! One of our main jobs is to allow and orchestrate change, which is where governance comes in. We need to create a process that we can use over and over again, and we need the right tools to make decisions and move the design system forward.\\nThe key is to make sure that everyone is playing by the same rules.\\nSo, the first step is to agree on the defined components and patterns that are part of the design system and make sure that the Figma library matches the Git Repository to avoid any discrepancies. We used Figma as the Definition of Ready document for development to keep things on track.\\nNow, if someone encounters an issue where the components aren’t solving a new use case, they can challenge the status quo.\\nIt doesn’t matter if they’re a designer, developer, or content designer — we encourage everyone to question whether something is working or not. Then, we work with the initiator to figure out if the new proposal applies to other use cases involving the same component. That way, we can make sure that everyone’s needs are met and we can keep moving forward!\\nIf you're looking for governance guidelines on Design Systems, then I have detailed them in a different article here.\\nThe consolidation process\\nA weekly session for designers to collaborate better\\nIf you were a designer in my company working on focused product segments, then I would advise you to present in one of the ‘UX Friday’ sessions, or you could just use the following steps to collaborate with the design system team to co-create.\\n3 Simple steps to make this happen:\\nOne of the main goals of the design system team is for every designer to feel empowered to take the initiative and suggest enhancements\\nto existing components or propose new ones that will solve issues that the design system doesn’t currently address. Don’t be afraid to speak up!\\n1. Prepare a component case:\\nPrepare your case in the Figma playground file. It’s a template that contains all sorts of helpful tools to share your proposal with the team. The playground file will ideally include :\\nA checklist to help you document your solution:\\nThis will help you explain how your proposed improvement solves the issue. If you’re improving an existing component, can you explain how it’s still usable for its initial use cases?\\nA checklist to help you ensure you’re applying the design system’s foundation and guidelines correctly:\\nYou want to make sure that your proposed change won’t negatively affect anything else in the system.\\nA space to provide the full context of the issue:\\nThis will help the team understand the problem better and see if other participants have experienced similar issues.\\nA space to show research results:\\nIf you have user research or examples of other design systems that handle similar issues well, this is the place to share them.\\nI\\nhave written a detailed article around “Vetting components for design system” which can provide more insights on this topic.\\n2. Present on a\\nconsolidation call\\n:\\nNext, present your\\ncomponent case\\nwith the Figma playground file in an open forum setting that occurs weekly or biweekly.\\nAnyone can join and participate, regardless of their discipline.\\nDuring the consolidation call, we’ll critique the proposal from multiple angles to strengthen the applicability of the component.\\nWe’ll gather examples of how we currently use the component and play around with the new proposal within our use cases.\\nThe consolidation call includes multiple participants, including at least one developer, and we may even invite participants from other disciplines, like a copywriter.\\nBy identifying every application of the component in these use cases, we can redefine the components’ usage in the Figma playground file.\\nOnce the consolidation has proven successful, you can implement the change by renewing the components page in Figma.\\n3. The Final Step:\\nThe final step is to get assistance from a designer on the design system team or hand the component entirely over to the DS team to add a few more details to the Figma playground file, including the naming of the component, a user story, types, states, and options defined, tokens or variables defined, breakpoint behavior, and more.\\nIn short, the consolidation process is all about empowering everyone to suggest changes, gather feedback, and arrive at a solution that works for everyone.\\nDon’t forget to push your PMs\\nWhen a changed component is encountered, the PM in charge of that area and will include it in your sprint planning. Usually, the feature team of the person who initiated the change will be the one to work on it. Finally, we make sure to communicate these changes to the business and update any relevant documents.\\nConclusion\\nBy establishing a clear and easy-to-follow process for proposing and implementing changes to the design system, everyone has an opportunity to share their ideas and contribute to its evolution. The “Figma playground file” is a valuable tool that enables team members to articulate their proposals in a clear and structured way, making it easier for the design system team to assess the impact of proposed changes and ensure they align with the design system’s core values and principles.\\nOne of the most enjoyable aspects of this process is the collaboration between designers from different disciplines during the consolidation process. This creates a greater understanding and appreciation of each other’s roles and expertise, which helps to build trust and foster a culture of collaboration.\\nUltimately, this process aligns with the core values of the design system, which are collaboration, clarity, and trust. By embracing these values and working together, we can create a design system that is both functional and sustainable and that meets the needs of all stakeholders.\\nLet me know your thoughts…\\n— — —\\nThanks for reading!
