      "Understand concepts better & choose the right technique for your needs with these key updates:\n",
      "- Explanations of quantization fundamentals (schemes, int4, FP8).\n",
      "https://lnkd.in/etQG9FQw\n",
      "- New Selection Guide: Choose the right technique (bnb, AWQ, GPTQ, HQQ, etc.) for your specific needs & hardware.\n",

      "What's quantization? It shrinks models (like Llama 3) & speeds up inference by using lower precision (int8, int4, FP8). Think smaller footprint, faster results!\n",
